It works! Vineyard has been deployed in your kubernetes.

The UNIX-domain socket is placed on hosts at:

    /var/run/vineyard-{{ .Release.Namespace }}-{{ include "vineyard.fullname" . }}

The vineyard RPC service could be found by:

    kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} describe service {{ include "vineyard.fullname" . }}-rpc
